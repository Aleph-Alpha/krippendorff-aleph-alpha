Krippendorff's Aleph Alpha

🚧 Project in Progress 🚧

This repository contains an implementation of Krippendorff’s Alpha, a statistical measure of inter-rater reliability designed for various data types (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio). The goal is to support multiple data formats (CSV, JSON, Pandas DataFrames), efficient computations, and dynamic updates for annotators.


Features (Planned & In Progress):

✔️ Support for multiple data types (Nominal, Ordinal, etc.)

✔️ Flexible data input formats (CSV, JSON, DataFrames)

✔️ Custom distance metrics for different applications

✔️ Performance optimizations (vectorization, sparse matrices)

✔️ Structured outputs with optional visualizations
Installation

This project is currently under development. Installation and usage instructions will be provided soon.
